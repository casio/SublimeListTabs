# List Tabs 

Shows a quick panel with all of the open tabs. 

Sometimes I want to remove the clutter and only see the edit area so I
hide the sidebar and the tabs. But now it's hard to get an overview of
your opened files and navigate them efficiently. To fix this I've
created this plug-in that shows your open tabs in a quick panel.

To install it simply:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    git clone https://mads379@github.com/mads379/SublimeListTabs.git

Now add a key-binding, I use:

    { "keys": ["super+t"], "command": "list_tabs"},
